class ParallelWithFinally(StateRetryCatchFinally):
	"""
	Models the ``ParallelWithFinally`` state, which allows concurrent processing of branches, with the overall state having
	an optional "finally" branch execution after all branches have completed, or when an error is raised that is caught by a ``Catcher``.

	Either:

	* ``EndState`` is ``True`` and ``NextState`` must be ``None``
	* ``EndState`` is ``False`` and ``NextState`` must be a valid instance of a class derived from ``StateBase``.

	Output is returned as a ``list`` of the outputs from each branch.

	:param Name: [Required] The name of the state within the branch of the state machine
	:type Name: str
	:param Comment: [Optional] A comment describing the intent of this pass state
	:type Comment: str
	:param InputPath: [Optional] Filter on the Input information to be passed to the Pass state.  Default is "$", signifying that all the Input information will be provided
	:type InputPath: str
	:param OutputPath: [Optional] Filter on the Output information to be returned from the Pass state.  Default is "$", signifying that all the result information will be provided
	:type OutputPath: str
	:param EndState: [Optional] Flag indicating if this state terminates a branch of the state machine.  Defaults to ``False``
	:type EndState: bool
	:param NextState: [Optional] Next state to be invoked within this branch.  Must not be ``None`` unless ``EndState`` is ``True``
	:type NextState: instance of class derived from ``StateBase``
	:param ResultPath: [Optional] JSONPath indicating where results should be added to the Input.  Defaults to "$", indicating results replace the Input entirely.
	:type ResultPath: str
	:param RetryList: [Optional] ``list`` of ``Retrier`` instances corresponding to error states that cause the entire set of branches to be retried
	:type: RetryList: list of ``Retrier``
	:param CatcherList: [Optional] ``list`` of ``Catcher`` instances corresponding to error states that can be caught and handled by further states being executed in the ``StateMachine``.
	:type: CatcherList: list of ``Catcher``
	:param FinallyState: [Optional] First state of the finally branch to be invoked
